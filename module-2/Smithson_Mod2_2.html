        <h2>Who is Asher? An Introduction</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            I moved to the Twin Cities in 2004 after spending ten years relocating from place to place. 
            Part of this was due to my service in the United States Air Force, while the rest was a search for a truly welcoming place. 
            Minnesota is where I finally put down roots, and I'm happy to call it home.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            One of my biggest hobbies is online role-playing games, especially those that incorporate interactive writing. 
            There is a vast online community of friends from all over the world, offering both support and camaraderie beyond gaming itself. 
            Meeting up with some of these friends for vacations has always been a fantastic and memorable experience.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching movies, walking, and attending concerts and theater performances. 
            <span class="sentence">Traveling once a year allows me to expand my knowledge and immerse myself in different cultures.</span> 
            Last year, I had an incredible time on a beer tour in Cologne, Germany, enjoying local brews and traditional cuisine—an experience I’d highly recommend to anyone.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Friendships are incredibly important to me, and I am fiercely loyal to those close to me. 
            However, I am also a very private person, and I tend to keep my circle of friends small.
