        <h2>About Kastyl</h2>
        <img src="images/testtime.jpg" alt="Getting Acquianted with Kastyl Romolo">
        <p>Kastyl Romolo is a thoughtful, hands-on professional who thrives in spaces where creativity and care come together. Currently working in a small, independent salon, Kastyl supports stylists with a broad range of responsibilities — from mixing formulas and removing foils to greeting clients and maintaining the calming environment of the space. Their approach to beauty is rooted in attention, artistry, and the belief that transformation can be both subtle and profound.

            Before entering the beauty field, Kastyl spent years in administrative work. That chapter, while steady, left them feeling disconnected from their sense of purpose. A pivotal moment — quiet but undeniable — made it clear that it was time to pursue something more meaningful. Beauty school wasn’t just a career switch; it was a return to their creative instincts and a step toward something tactile and expressive.
        
            Kastyl completed their training in 2024 and earned their cosmetology license. Though early in their career, they bring a professionalism and humility that has already made them an asset in the salon. They understand the value of support — and show up fully in that role while they continue to learn.
        
            Whether assisting with a client’s color process or refreshing a workspace with fresh flowers, Kastyl brings intention to everything they do. Their goal is not just to grow in skill, but to contribute to spaces where people feel seen, cared for, and renewed.</p>
