        <p>Whether it's an Uber ride on a rainy day or a moment's respite between clients, Kastyl enjoys the creative fun of building a world for cats often named after friends both near and far.</p>

        <p>Kastyl displays masterful creativity when exploring within World of Warcraft and within the sessions of their D&D group, finding creative outlets in the adventure themselves. Even when the dice go awry, they have this uncanny ability to transform those moments into compelling new avenues for the story to unfold.</p>

        <p>Living within a bustling, sprawling city and now involved with a new career, Kastyl seeks nature wherever and whenever they get the chance. A small trip outside the city limits or a long journey to visit family across borders, flowers and mushrooms cannot hide from Kastyl's expert eye. They are always generous to share pictures of the treasures they discover with friends.</p>
