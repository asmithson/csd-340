                <h2> Welcome to Kastyl's Story</h2>
                <p>From handling hazard calls to highlighting hair — this is the story of transformation.

                    Working in the office of a pest control company, Kastyl spent their days managing problems from a distance. When a client called about an infestation, it wasn’t their hands setting traps — it was paperwork, phone calls, and long hours behind a desk. But one day, sitting across from a coworker celebrating ten years in the same role, they saw a future they didn’t want.

                    That single moment sparked a shift. Creativity has always lived in them, waiting for space to grow. By the end of the year, they had left their job to enroll in beauty school- never to look back.
 
                    Since then, their world has been filled with color, literally and figuratively. They’ve embraced the beauty industry, a career where change is visible, progress is hands-on, and connection is everything.

                    Today, Kastyl is learning the rhythm of the beauty industry from the ground up while working in a small, independent salon. This site shares their journey — the courage to change, the joy in creative work, and the hobbies and dreams that continue to shape their path.</p>

                <p>While working at the pest control office, Kastyl spent their days relaying distress calls, dispatching others to solve urgent problems — but never seeing the outcome firsthand. “A guy sets the traps and you hope they work,” they said, reflecting on the distance that defined that role.

                The lack of color in that chapter — and in the photo — is foretelling.</p>

                <p>Seeing the transformation begin as Kastyl entered beauty school is evident through the introduction of vibrance — not only in expression, but through color. Gone were the grays of fluorescent-lit offices; in their place came foils, formulas, and newfound confidence. With every class, every client, and every color correction, Kastyl was no longer dispatching solutions from a distance — they were creating them with their own hands.</p>

                <p>With beauty school behind them and a license in hand, Kastyl entered the field with both nervousness and pride. “Even though it’s hard, and it does get hard, I know I’m just beginning,” they shared. The shift hasn’t gone unnoticed. One of the first people to comment was their own stylist: “You have this sparkle that you didn’t have the last few times I’ve seen you.”

                    That sparkle isn’t just a compliment — it’s a sign of something real. The weight of their old job has lifted, replaced by a career that reflects who they are and where they’re going.</p>

            <h2>About Kastyl Romolo</h2>
            <p>Kastyl Romolo is a thoughtful, hands-on professional who thrives in spaces where creativity and care come together. Currently working in a small, independent salon, Kastyl supports stylists with a broad range of responsibilities — from mixing formulas and removing foils to greeting clients and maintaining the calming environment of the space. Their approach to beauty is rooted in attention, artistry, and the belief that transformation can be both subtle and profound.

                Before entering the beauty field, Kastyl spent years in administrative work. That chapter, while steady, left them feeling disconnected from their sense of purpose. A pivotal moment — quiet but undeniable — made it clear that it was time to pursue something more meaningful. Beauty school wasn’t just a career switch; it was a return to their creative instincts and a step toward something tactile and expressive.
                
                Kastyl completed their training in 2024 and earned their cosmetology license. Though early in their career, they bring a professionalism and humility that has already made them an asset in the salon. They understand the value of support — and show up fully in that role while they continue to learn.
                
                Whether assisting with a client’s color process or refreshing a workspace with fresh flowers, Kastyl brings intention to everything they do. Their goal is not just to grow in skill, but to contribute to spaces where people feel seen, cared for, and renewed.</p>
