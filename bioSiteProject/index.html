        <h2>Welcome to Rose T's Story</h2>
        <div class="text-highlight">
          <p>From handling hazard calls to highlighting hair — this is the story of transformation.

          Working in the office of a pest control company, Rose T spent their days managing problems from a distance. The calls were urgent, the work was steady, but the results? Distant and unfulfilling. Watching a colleague celebrate ten years in that same role made one thing clear — that wasn’t the future Rose T wanted.<br>

          So they left. And in doing so, chose something brave: creativity.<br>

          Enrolling in beauty school wasn’t just about changing careers — it was about stepping into a space where color, expression, and transformation are tangible. Now, Rose T brings that spark to a small, independent salon where learning and connection go hand in hand.<br>

          This site highlights their journey: the courage to begin again, the color they bring to their work, and the hobbies and dreams that make them who they are.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="text-highlight">
          <p>Working behind the scenes in a pest control office meant solving problems — but never witnessing solutions. “A guy sets the traps and you hope they work,” Rose T shared, summing up the disconnect that defined that job. The lack of vibrancy in those days — and in this photo — says it all.</p>
