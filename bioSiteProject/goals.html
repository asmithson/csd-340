      <h2>Goals +: Glimpse into Rose T's Achievements and Future Plans</h2>

      <!-- 1st Goal -->
      <div class="goal-entry">
        <div class="tooltip"> 
          <img src="images/learningstyle.jpg" alt="Milestone: Practicing Curls">
          <span class="tooltip-text">Rose T. practicing curls — a milestone in their beauty school journey.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="text-highlight-blue">
          <p>One of Rose T's earliest milestones in beauty school came during curl practice. Styling curls with precision is no small feat — it reflects technique, patience, and an understanding of hair texture.</p>
          <p>Rose T hopes to continue refining these skills to master more complex curl patterns and textured styles.</p>

      <!-- 2nd Goal -->
      <div class="goal-entry">
        <div class="tooltip"> 
          <img src="images/braidingpractice.jpg" alt="Self-braiding Success!">
          <span class="tooltip-text">Rose T. celebrating a self-braiding success!</span>
        </div>
        <div class="text-highlight-blue">
          <p>Braiding someone else's hair is one thing. Braiding your own takes a different kind of skill. Rose T celebrated a win when successfully braiding their own hair — a test of both dexterity and patience.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, Rose T is excited to explore more intricate braiding patterns and incorporate them into creative color work and formal styling for events like weddings.</p>
