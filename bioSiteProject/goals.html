        <h2>Goals +</h2>

        <!-- 1st Goal -->
         <div class="goal-entry">
            <img src="images/learningstyle.jpg" alt="Milestone: Practicing Curls">
            <p>
                One of Rose T.'s earliest milestones in beauty school came during curl practice. Styling curls with precision is no small feat - it reflects technique, patience, and understanding hair texture.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 2nd Goal -->
        <div class="goal-entry">
            <img src="images/braidingpractice.jpg" alt="Self-braiding Success!">
            <p>
                Braiding someone else's hair is one thing. Braiding your own takes a different kind of skill. Rose T. celebrated a win when successsfully braiding on their own hair - a test of both dexterity and patience.

        <div class="goal-entry">
            <img src="images/grad_day.jpg" alt="Graduation Day">
            <p>
                Graduation wasn't just a finish line - it marked courage, growth, and a complete transformation. Rose T. left behind a stable career to follow their passion, and this photo celebrates that achievement.

        <!-- Shoutout -->
        <div class="shoutout">
            <img src="images/partnerflowers.jpg" alt="Quiet Thanks to Their Support">
            <p>
                This bouquet quietly honors the support Rose T. received along the way. Given to them by their partner and classmates on graduation day, the flowers reflect more than a milestone - they represent shared pride, encouragement, and the meaningful bonds built throughout the journey. A quiet reminder that even bold transformations are rarely done alone.
