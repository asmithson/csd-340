            <p>Rose T is a hands-on, creative individual who finds joy in transformation—both in hair and life. After stepping away from a stable but uninspiring job in pest control, Rose T took a leap of faith and enrolled in beauty school, driven by a deep love for color, artistry, and working directly with people. That decision, while daunting at the time, became the start of a more fulfilling, expressive, and empowering path.</p>

            <p>Today, Rose T works in a small independent salon, where their days are filled with mixing formulas, rinsing out colors, washing hair, and prepping foils. But they also bring out their spark in the role by designing fun and engaging Instagram posts for the business—something their coworkers are happy to pass off and that Rose T genuinely enjoys. It’s a blend of behind-the-scenes support and creative expression that suits their style and builds trust with the team.</p>

            <p>Their long-term career goals center around becoming a color specialist, especially working with vivid hues blended into natural tones. Rose T also hopes to gain experience in bridal and event styling in the future, helping people feel their most confident on their most important days.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, Rose T recharges through hiking and foraging, playing Nintendo games with their sisters, and participating in tabletop RPGs filled with math, storytelling, and chance.</p>

            <p>Starting beauty school was a hard choice—but one that paid off. Rose T now carries more confidence, a stronger sense of purpose, and the kind of sparkle that others can’t help but notice.</p>
